Blockchain Industry Use Cases Question Practice 

Problem Statment 1

Blockchain technology came into the ground to overcome these issues. It offers decentralized nodes for the banking system and is used to produce a transparent banking system for its end to end verification advantages. This technology is a replacement for the traditional banking system with distributed, nonrepudiation and security protection characteristics. 
You are a blockchain expert in a major corporate bank and have been tasked to create a smart contract to perform banking transactions. Create a smart contract for a banking application in solidity that allow users to do the following:
Mint money into your Application
Withdraw money from your account
Send money from your account to smart contract address
Check balance


Problem Statement 2

Blockchain is a technology designed to manage patient data that has the potential to support transparency and accountability. A blockchain is a ledger of transactions where an identical copy is visible to all the members of a computer network. Network members validate the data entered into the ledger, and once entered, the data is immutable.
Create a solution where you can store the electronic health record of the patients in a distributed and decentralized network. You should be able to query and change the ownership of the record as necessary.


Problem Statement 3

Blockchain is a technology designed to manage education data that has the potential to support transparency and accountability. A blockchain is a ledger of transactions where an identical copy is visible to all the members of a computer network. Network members validate the data entered into the ledger, and once entered, the data is immutable.
Design a solution where you can store the digital certificates of the students in a distributed and decentralized network. You should be able to add the certificated details into the blockchain query the certificate details from the blockchain.


Problem Statement 4

Blockchain is a technology which enables elections to be done transparently. We can avoid rigging or any corrupt activities using the technology and should be able to make sure that the votes are also accounted for on a real-time basis. Design an electronic voting system, using the ethereum blockchain (smart contracts) and more precisely the RPC test which enables account generation with a private and public key. Blockchain electronic voting system using smart contracts.


Problem Statement 5

Smart cities and smart houses are in fashion and thus all this can be kept in a blockchain. We can focus on building system which can manage all the real estate related contracts through blockchain technology which will enhance security and will provide more efficiency.
Design a smart contract using the Ethereum blockchain in a distributed and decentralized network. You should be able to add the property details to the blockchain, query the property details from the blockchain and should be able to change the ownership of the property appropriately.


Problem Statement 6

Food items like fruits and vegetables generally do not have any expiry date mentioned so it becomes important to understand the origin of these food items and know the date when was it sent to the distributor from the farmer and so on. Design a smart contract using the ethereum blockchain where you should be able to authenticate the food item and consume that without any worry


Problem Statement 7

Blockchain is a technology that enables identities to be stored transparently. It offers decentralized nodes for end-to-end verification advantages. This technology is a replacement for traditional identity management with distributed, nonrepudiation, and security protection characteristics.
Design a smart contract using the Ethereum blockchain where you should be able to store the identity details in the blockchain and should be able to query the details of the identity from the blockchain
